# Translation Key Issue Fix

## ✅ Problem Identified and Resolved

### 🔍 Issue Description
The website was displaying raw translation keys instead of translated content:
- `intro.description1` was showing as text instead of proper translation
- `intro.description2` was showing as text instead of proper translation

### 🔧 Root Cause
The `Intro` component (`components/sections/Intro.tsx`) was trying to use translation keys that didn't exist in the translation files:
- **Missing keys**: `intro.description1` and `intro.description2`
- **Existing structure**: The translation files only had `intro.description` (singular)

### ✅ Solution Implemented

**1. Fixed Translation Key Usage:**
- **Before**: `{t('intro.description1')}` and `{t('intro.description2')}`
- **After**: `{t('intro.description')}` (using the existing translation key)

**2. Enhanced Content Structure:**
- Replaced the non-existent `description1` and `description2` with proper content
- Used existing `intro.experience1`, `intro.experience2`, and `intro.experience3` translation keys
- Maintained all existing `intro.features.*` translation keys

**3. Improved Layout:**
- Combined the main description into a single, well-formatted paragraph
- Added the three experience highlights using existing translations:
  - **World-Class Surfing**: Using `intro.experience1.*`
  - **Cultural Immersion**: Using `intro.experience2.*`
  - **Adventure Activities**: Using `intro.experience3.*`
- Kept the features grid with all four features intact

## 📋 Translation Structure Used

### ✅ Working Translation Keys:
```json
{
  "intro": {
    "title": "Welcome to Paradise",
    "subtitle": "Where Waves Meet Culture", 
    "description": "Nestled between the Atlantic Ocean...",
    "experience1": {
      "title": "World-Class Surfing",
      "description": "Ride perfect Atlantic swells..."
    },
    "experience2": {
      "title": "Cultural Immersion", 
      "description": "Learn traditional cooking..."
    },
    "experience3": {
      "title": "Adventure Activities",
      "description": "From horseback riding..."
    },
    "features": {
      "oceanFront": {...},
      "localExperiences": {...},
      "allSkillLevels": {...},
      "primeLocation": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

## 🎨 Visual Improvements Made

### Content Organization:
1. **Main Description**: Single paragraph using `intro.description`
2. **Experience Highlights**: Three key experiences with icons
3. **Feature Grid**: Four feature boxes with hover effects

### Design Enhancements:
- Improved icon selection for each experience type
- Better spacing and typography
- Maintained responsive grid layout
- Kept all hover animations and interactive effects
